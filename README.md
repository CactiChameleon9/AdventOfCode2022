# Advent Of Code 2022
My Rust Solutions for the Advent of Code 2022! Note: this is my way of learning rust, no promises the rust code is any good (`cargo` being fussy does help though)

My solutions will not be the most efficent :)

To run each day's solution, enter the respective day's directory and run `cargo run`
