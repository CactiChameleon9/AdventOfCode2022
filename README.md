# Advent Of Code 2022

This repo contains my advent of code solutions for 2022!
I will be attempting to learn rust through this but you may find I fall back on python due to it being quite good at data crunching


My solutions are probably very inefficient :)

To run each day's solution, enter the respective day's directory and run `cargo run`
